MATERIAL DESIGN FOR OMNIGRAFFLE
========================================

This is an Omnigraffle stencil that mirrors the official [Google Material Design sticker sheet](https://material.google.com/resources/sticker-sheets-icons.html) as closely as possible.

INSTALLATION
------------

### Install the stencil (OmniGraffle 6)

* Double-click the stencil or template to open it in OmniGraffle
* Click the **Move** button to install it locally

### Install the stencil (OmniGraffle 5)

* Drag or copy the stencil file to `~/Library/Application Support/The Omni Group/OmniGraffle/Stencils`

(If you have an older version of OmniGraffle these folders may be in `~/Library/Application Support/OmniGraffle/`)

**Note:** Recent versions of OSX hide the user's Library folder by default. You can access it in Finder by holding down **Option** while opening the **Go** menu then clicking on **Library**.
